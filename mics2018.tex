\section{Introduction}
Clojure~\cite{Hickey:2008}, amongst other functional languages \emcomment{comma?} have gained attention in recent years
in part for their \emcomment{its (or change the sentence structure if you want to talk about all functional languages)} management of state and concurrency.
Clojure, which runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) has a number of advantages for beginning students.
Its Lisp style syntax and elegant core library
 work together to let beginners learn easily, while
its ties to the JVM keep it relevant as students progress into later courses.

\emcomment{However,} From an educational perspective, it has a significant flaw in the form of error messages.
As Clojure code runs in the JVM, its errors take the structure and terminology of Java error messages,
and so are confusing to new students. They can understand the source of the error,
but not how the system presents it to them.
For example, a user who accidentally called addition on a boolean needs
 to understand the Java object hierarchy, casting,
 and the classes involved to fully understand what is meant by
 ``java.lang.classCastException java.lang.Boolean cannot be cast to java.lang.Number'',
whereas the background required to understand ``+ needs all arguments to be numbers, not true''
 is significantly lower. \comment{is this a good rephrasing?} \emcomment{well, this is not our actual error in this situation. The actual error is:
``In function + the first argument true must be a number, but is a boolean''} 
 In order to overcome these problems,
  we demonstrate an integration with commonly used tools in the Clojure community
 to transform error messages into simplified forms before they are presented to the user.
\emcomment{we have explored possibilities for integrating custom-made error messages with commonly used tools in the Clojure community}




\section{Error Messages in Clojure}
Clojure is hosted and interpretted in the JVM, with Clojure code either being
loaded by a Clojure process, or compiled Ahead Of Time (AOT compilation) into Java code.
Either way, while Clojure is being run, it is essentially a Java program, consisting of
Clojure classes written in Java carrying out their programming. 
\emcomment{hmmm, I am not sure what this (previous) sentence means}
To the programmer, as much as possible, their code stays within Clojure,
the Java foundation thoroughly abstracted away.
\emcomment{Also could be phrased better}
This allows Clojure to act as a language, and not a library, but it means
 that when an exception is thrown, it's thrown from under Clojure's abstractions
 and so contains a great deal of information about the state of Clojure itself
 during the error, and less information relating to what exactly went wrong in the
 programmers own code.
\emcomment{Perhaps the key here is that the JVM doesn't perceives the code as Java, and thus just throws a Java exception,
and Clojure objects are referred to only as Java classes that implement them}
 For a novice programmer, the error message is confusingly laced
  with Java terms and ideas, and the advanced features of Java that Clojure uses.
  Furthermore, as the error message is from a Java standpoint, it often misses
  information useful in debugging, such as actual values involved in some erroring function calls.

\section{Clojure Spec}
Clojure Spec is a library within Clojure allowing runtime validation
of the structure of data within the application, with flexibility and precision.
As it can be used to validate arguments to functions, by providing Spec
 specifications for the Clojure core functions, we can gain Spec errors
 for misapplied functions. the data Spec error messages contain lets us build
 error messages with better understanding of the errror that caused them. 
As novice programmers would not use external libraries,
 all functions that they can access would hold Spec specifications.
\emcomment{If Spec validation is provided for all Clojure core functions, 
this would likely be sufficient for novice programmers since it would be 
rare for them to use functions beyond Clojure core.} 
\emcomment{Note that this only provides errors for function parameters 
type errors; syntax errors cannot be handled via Spec.}
\emcomment{Also mention here or elsewhere that the research group at UMM has been 
working on providing error messages rewriting system, and the final piece to figure
out is how to integrate it with Clojure ecosystem.}


\section{Clojure, REPL and the IDE}
\emcomment{Add a citation when you first mention spec - see bibliography, it has one}
As Clojure loads code for execution, it reads in code as a string,
and then parses it. As Clojure is homoiconic, fully evaluating all values in the data structure
is equivalent to running the code.
As such, a common system in Clojure is the Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL), whereby a running Clojure
process reads in data, evaluates it, and then prints the resulting value,
 waiting for the next user input before looping.
This system lets a user experiment with code as it is written,
 evaluating sub-expressions and building up complex functions.
Many Clojure IDEs offer a way to interact with a REPL as part of their services,
 and REPL driven development is a common pattern in the Clojure community.
 As the REPL spans both evaluating code and presenting the results of evaluation to users,
 the REPL is a logical place for our transformation of error messages to be implemented.
 To maximize the adaptability of our code, implementing a custom REPL limits integration
 options with IDEs, and with users workflow in general.
  Finding an expandable REPL implementation to add our message processing to
  is ideal. \emcomment{would be ideal, and that was the goal of our project}


\section{nREPL}
\emcomment{Add a citation when you first mention nREPL - use Spec citation as a sample}
nREPL is a community standard implementation of the REPL concept,
allowing easy creation, connection and management of REPL servers.
It is integrated with Leiningen, a commonly used project and dependency manager,
 and with many IDEs. Moreover, it includes the ability to add custom middleware,
  changing the way the server reads and reacts to code.
 nREPL communicates between its client and server by means of messages.
 By intercepting messages from the server containing error messages,
 we can replace the Java errors with our errors,
  without the user experience changing inadvertently.
\emcomment{Mention that in this case whether the user interacts with a REPL directly or via an IDE,
the error messages would be replaced by the middleware in exactly the same way, providing consistent 
user experience.}
  Keeping the middleware to only manipulating error messages
  is preferred, so as not cause side effects that would perplex the user.

\section{Conclusion}
By harnessing the systems already built for Clojure,
such as Spec and nREPL, we gain needed information.
\emcomment{again, keep in mind that spec only checks function calls. If code is broken 
in a way that it never reaches a call (for instance, it has a syntax error), Spec is not helpful. 
Our system of replacing error messages handles both cases; you just have to be careful 
when you are describing it to not give an impression that it's only Spec that's used.}
By intercepting the display of error messages, we avoid changing users
interactions with the REPL in hidden ways, and allow our code to
be smoothly integrated into other tools as a user added nREPL middleware.
  This alleviates the problems that prevent Clojures
 adoption as a first programming language, and allow its strengths
 and ties to the Java ecosystem to keep it relevant as the student's skills increase.
\emcomment{This provides the final element for building a system that would allow....}
\emcomment{We should tone it down because Spec-based errors are basically just a proof of concept,
and your demo would also be a proof of concept, rather than a completely fleshed out system - mention the term ``proof of concept'' somewhere.}
